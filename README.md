greasemonkey-printable-jira
===========================

Greasemonkey script for formatting Jira tickets into a small, printable format.

How to use (Firefox):

1. Install the Greasemonkey add-on to you Firefox browser
2. With Firefox visit the RAW greasemonkey script in this repository (https://github.com/opentable/greasemonkey-printable-jira/raw/master/greasemonkey-printable-jira.user.js) - and you'll be automatically prompted to install the script
3. Click install

The next time you visit an individual Jira ticket it will reformat the page to a printable card.  Disable the Greasemonkey script to revert back to the previous format.

Update March 2013: The Atlassian OnDemand JIRA 6.0 redesign has changed some of the mark-up on the Jira ticket pages, so whilst the Greasemonkey script still works it doesn't hide all the same fields that it used to.
